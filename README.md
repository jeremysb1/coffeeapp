## About the Project

### Find the best nearby coffee shops.

This app helps folks find nearby coffee shops, check out their ratings, and rate the ones they frequented.

I built this project to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I also learned CSS Modules.

The app uses an API to update nearby coffee shops based on your location.
