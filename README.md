## Why Use Next.js

- Static Site Generation (SSG)

 This means the page HTML is generated at build time. That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run next build . This HTML will then be reused on each request. It's cached by a CDN.

- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Next.js allows you to create or update static pages after youâ€™ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.

- Server Side Rendering (SSR)

The HTML is generated on each request.

6. Upgrade to Next.js Version 12:  https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading
